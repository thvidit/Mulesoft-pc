### PUT/customers/{customerId}
This endpoint will trigger flow putCustomerFromSFDC which updates a customer information by customerId. 

### GET/channels
This endpoint will trigger flow getChannels which obtains mocked information about supported channels. 
The main point is to support the most common channels to cover use-cases with WEB, mobile and brick-and-mortar(store) based application delivering the Omnichannel user experience.

### GET/channels/{channelId}
This endpoint will trigger flow getChannel which obtains mocked information about particular channel by channelId.

### GET/channels/{channelId}/paymentMethods
This endpoint will trigger flow getChannel's payment methods by channelId. 
Channels basically could have different payment methods according to channel type like VISA card, bank transfer, cash.

### GET/products/{productId}/variants/{variantId}
This endpoint will trigger flow getVariantByProduct which obtains mocked information about variant of product by productId and variantId.

### GET/products/{productId}/variants/{variantId}/availability
This endpoint will trigger flow getAvailability which obtains mocked information about availability of variant by productId and variantId.

### GET/categories/{categoryId}/products

# Considerations <a name="considerations"/>

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. **Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

## APIs security considerations <a name="apissecurityconsiderations"/>
This Experience API is meant to be deployed to CloudHub and managed using the API Platform Manager.
   

# Run it! <a name="runit"/>
Simple steps to get Retail Omnichannel Experience API running.
See below.

## Running on premise <a name="runonopremise"/>
In this section we detail the way you should run your Anypoint Template on your computer.


### Where to Download Mule Studio and Mule ESB
First thing to know if you are a newcomer to Mule is where to get the tools.

+ You can download Mule Studio from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio)
+ You can download Mule ESB from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-open-source-esb)

### Importing an Anypoint Template into Studio
Mule Studio offers several ways to import a project into the workspace, for instance: 

+ Anypoint Studio generated Deployable Archive (.zip)
+ Anypoint Studio Project from External Location
+ Maven-based Mule Project from pom.xml
+ Mule ESB Configuration XML from External Location

You can find a detailed description on how to do so in this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Importing+and+Exporting+in+Studio).

### Running on Studio <a name="runonstudio"/>
Once you have imported you Anypoint Template into Anypoint Studio you need to follow these steps to run it:

+ Generate keystore and truststore (You can find a detailed description on how to do so in this [Documentation Page](https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/tls-configuration#generating-keystores-and-truststores))
+ Locate the properties file `mule-<env>.properties`, in src/main/app/resources
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the section [Properties to be configured](#propertiestobeconfigured)
+ Once that is done, right click on you Anypoint Template project folder 
+ Hover you mouse over `"Run as"`
+ Click on  `"Mule Application"`

### Running on Mule ESB stand alone <a name="runonmuleesbstandalone"/>
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties](../master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`. 

## Running on CloudHub <a name="runoncloudhub"/>
While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to `"Manage Application"` > `"Properties"` to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured**.
Follow other steps defined [here](#runonpremise) and once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else.

### Deploying your Anypoint Template on CloudHub <a name="deployingyouranypointtemplateoncloudhub"/>
Mule Studio provides you with really easy way to deploy your Template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so please check this [link](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Deploying+Mule+Applications#DeployingMuleApplications-DeploytoCloudHub)

## Properties to be configured (With examples) <a name="propertiestobeconfigured"/>
In order to use this Mule Anypoint Template you need to configure properties (Credentials, configurations, etc.) either in properties file or in CloudHub as Environment Variables.
